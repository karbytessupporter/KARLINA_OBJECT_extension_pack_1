<p>S: &#8220;Are numbers noumena or are numbers phenomena?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;I would say that any finite sequence of numeric digits (with no more than one radix and no more than one sign) which is currently being represented as a pattern of physical objects inside of some information processing agent&#8217;s hardware (even if that information processing agent is merely a component of a software simulation) is a number which exists as a phenomenon from the perspective of that information processing agent&#8217;s encompassing universe. In other words, the only numbers I consider to actually exist are the values (which phenotypically manifest as finite linear sequences of numeric digits (with no more than one radix per sequence and no more than one sign per sequence)) which are currently being represented by whatever computer program variables are currently instantiated. I believe that most numbers which are theorized to exist are each in a purely noumenal state most of the time rather than in a phenomenal state most of the time (though I could be wrong (especially if all imaginable phenomena exist simultaneously and eternally throughout a limitlessly large set of parallel and temporally circular universes)).&#8221;</p>
<p>S: &#8220;Are you suggesting that, if all imaginable phenomena exist simultaneously and eternally throughout a limitlessly large set of parallel and temporally circular universes, there are as many phenomenal numbers as there are noumenal numbers (from the perspective of an all-encompassing multiverse)?&#8221;</p>
<p>T: &#8220;Initially, I am inclined to say yes to your question because, if all imaginable phenomena exist simultaneously and eternally throughout a limitlessly large set of isolated and limitlessly repeating universes, then there are infinitely many phenomenal incarnations of each noumenal number throughout all time (i.e. throughout the boundlessly large multiverse). I do not think it is possible for a spatially and temporally finite information processing agent to algebraically compare two infinities the way that information processing agent can algebraically compare the numbers 5 and 2 (to see that there is a precise difference of 3 spaces on the number line between the points labeled 2 and 5). Hence, I reason that any object is always either known (to some beholder) as a spatially, temporally, and energetically finite pattern or else that object is not known to that particular beholder and possibly neither to any other beholders.&#8221;</p>
