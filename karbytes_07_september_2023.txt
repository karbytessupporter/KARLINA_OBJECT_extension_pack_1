Within the past 24 hours, karbytes changed the name of a public karbytes-created GitHub repository from RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY to RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY_first_67.

Within the past 24 hours, karbytes archived (i.e. made "read-only") the public karbytes-created GitHub repository named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY_first_67.

I did something I usually forbid: updated a journal entry whose file name features exactly one calendar day date. 

What I did specifically was change the date value in the pseudocode comment key-value pair from 06_SEPTEMBER_2023 to 07_SEPTEMBER_2023 and add dates to the videos in the list in that file named karbytes_07_september_2023.txt at the following uniform resource locator:

Within the past three hours karbytes downloaded each of the GitHub repository zip files needed to substantiate all of the content which comprises the websites named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com before this section of this note file was added by karbytes.

Those files were downloaded onto karbytes' secondary laptop (which runs Windows 10 as its operating system). Later today karbytes' plans to burn three M_DISC optical discs and take a souvenir photograph of the finished product to showcase on Instagram.

For the purpose of keeping the three M_DISC DVD discs which I am in the process of burning each with the folder named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY_07_september_2023 from getting scratched or exposed to corrosive chemicals and heat, I decided to (use scissors to) cut the compact disc sleeves out of the hard plastic compact disc case I ordered so that I can stack the M_DISC DVD discs inside of that zipper locking case while each of those discs is encased inside of its own plastic and cardboard "jewel case". I am putting paper with "permanent" black ink writing on them which describes the contents of the disc which karbytes intended to leave in that "jewel case" (at least until a better storage mechanism for the disc collection is deployed).

(Note that the Windows disc burner application forced me to make the disc name short. Hence I named each of those three discs karbytes_2023).

Each disc has been taking approximately 30 minutes to burn (and the total data size of that folder to burn is 3.93 Gigabytes).

In a nutshell, the GitHub repository which best encapsulates the theme of data which has been burned to those discs is located at the following uniform resource locator:

https://github.com/karlinarayberinger/RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY_first_67

After karbytes burned the three discs and tested to verify that the files enscribed onto those discs was readable to the machine which burned those discs (and karbytes did discover that each of those discs was readable as intended by karbytes by that machine (with sufficient confidence less than absolute certainty)), karbytes took two pictures of those discs displayed inside of their jewel cases with the hand-written note paper pieces sticking out of the inside pockets of the jewel cases, digitally modified those images for aesthetic enhancement according to karbytes, and uploaded those images as Instagram posts on karbytes' public Instagram account.

Those images can be viewed at the following uniform resource locators:

karbytes was able to copy the folder containing 76 zip files (of karbytes-created GitHub repositories) from M_DISC in LG DVD "plug-and-play" DVD player on karbytes' primary machine (which has a Kubuntu operating system). karbytes was not able to write the M_DISCs using the primary machine, but karbytes was able to at least read the "read only" M_DISCs on the primary machine. (A smaller secondary machine which has a Windows 10 operating system was used to write those M_DISCs) to the Desktop of the primary machine. That Desktop folder contains a total of 3.9 Gigabytes.
