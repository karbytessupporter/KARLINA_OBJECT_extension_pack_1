I did something I usually forbid: updated a journal entry whose file name features exactly one calendar day date. 

What I did specifically was change the date value in the pseudocode comment key-value pair from 06_SEPTEMBER_2023 to 07_SEPTEMBER_2023 and add dates to the videos in the list in that file named karbytes_07_september_2023.txt at the following uniform resource locator:
