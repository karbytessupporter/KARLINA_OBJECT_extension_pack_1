I did something I usually forbid: updated a journal entry whose file name features exactly one calendar day date. 

What I did specifically was change the date value in the pseudocode comment key-value pair from 06_SEPTEMBER_2023 to 07_SEPTEMBER_2023 and add dates to the videos in the list in that file named karbytes_07_september_2023.txt at the following uniform resource locator:

Within the past three hours karbytes downloaded each of the GitHub repository zip files needed to substantiate all of the content which comprises the websites named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com before this section of this note file was added by karbytes.
