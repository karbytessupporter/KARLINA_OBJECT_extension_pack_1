On 04_SEPTEMBER_2023 the following items which I ordered from Amazon dot Com arrived at my doorstep today:

(a) the pack of three (Hitachi-LG Data Storage) M-DISC 4.1 Gigabyte-capacity optical discs (which are said to be able to preserve read-only digital information which is burned onto it for up to one thousand Earth years)

(b) the (Siveit) purple-colored hard plastic (polypropylene) zip-locking case for storing up to 48 compact discs such as M-DISKs.

When I got to my dad's house to try burning the folder on the desktop of my laptop (which is a Hewlett-Packard laptop which originally came with Windows 10 as its only installed operating system before I installed Kubuntu on it using a bootable flash drive which I created using an online tutorial and free tools such as balenaEtcher) named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY (which contains the first 67 GitHub repository whole-repository downloads in the form of zip files which are enumerated in the web page named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY on the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com), I was unable to get the Kubuntu operating system to recognize that the LG slim portable DVD writer which was plugged into it via USB port.

I fetched one of my backup laptops from the storage bins in my room (and that one is a small Hewlett-Packard laptop which seems to only work if I bootup its native Windows 10 operating system instead of the non-functional Kubuntu operating system I partitioned some of that laptop's hard drive for). I tested the DVD writer/player with that laptop and it seemed to work. 

Then I tried using the only USB flash drive I have available to transfer that folder named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY on my primary laptop to my backup laptop but that USB flash drive appears to be read-only (and has been turned into a bootable Kubuntu flash drive). What that means is that I am simply going to have to create a new folder on my secondary laptop named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY and download each of the 67 zip files from GitHub (which I expect to take a longer time than it did for me to download those zip files the first time on the public Whole Foods Market Wi-Fi network in Dublin because the Wi-Fi network at my legal residence is slow and unreliable). 

When I am done with that chore, I will take a photograph of the finalized M-DISC collection and case and stow one of the three discs in a metal safe in my room while I take the other two M-DISCS with me in that purple case in my backpack.

I noticed that some of the files which I uploaded to GitHub today are not allowing me to view their raw file counterparts due to a Varnish cache server error (see the screenshot image named varnish_cache_server_error_github_04_september_2023.png). I think that is a temporary server error and that I will be able to access the raw files in a few hours (and no longer than 48 hours total).

I have gotten what I think is approximately 25% of the current M_DISC project done tonight. The erorr which I mentioned in the previous section of this note has come and gone. I also got an error message a few times while trying to download a GitHub repository's entire contents in the form of a zip file (by pressing the green "code" button on that GitHub repository's web page). The error is depicted by the image which I also uploaded to this GitHub repository named github_angry_unicorn_error_page_04_september_2023.png.

The Wi-Fi network seemed to be slowing down to the extent that I predicted that it would take several days to do what I thought would have taken me less than one hour: burn those M_DISCs with the first 66 GitHub repositories. So I bicycled over to my mom's house which is located on the west side of Castro Valley (because the Wi-Fi at my mom's house seems to be much faster and more reliable than the Wi-Fi at my dad's house). Since then I was able to make progress on the GitHub repository zip file downloads at my mom's house, but several times I got booted off the Wi-Fi and, for a few minutes, that Wi-Fi network appeared to be offline. It's approximately 4:44AM right now. I expect to be able to take a picture of the burned M_DISC collection using sunlight in approximately two hours.

I used the Ookla website to check the speed of the Wi-Fi Internet connection at my mom's house this morning and saw that the download speed was approximately 8.63 megabits per second and the upload speed was approximately 4.27 megabits per second. (See the screenshot image named ookla_internet_speed_test_results_05_september_2023.png for details).
