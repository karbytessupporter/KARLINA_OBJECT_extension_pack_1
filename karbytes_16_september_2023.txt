It is approximately 11:30PM Pacific Standard Time on 16_SEPTEMBER_2023 at the time this note is being made (and where I am located at this time is the East Dublin BART platform waiting for the westbound train to arrive. Today I was arrested for approximately nine hours (in a small chilly room with two other inmates) as a result of getting caught by the property managers or prospective buyers of a three-story model home whose backyard I got into the habit of using as a place to camp during the past three weeks. On 16_OCTOBER_2023 at 9:00AM Pacific Standard Time in room 712 at East County Hall of Justice (which is within a quarter mile of where I was jailed at today: Santa Rita County Jail) I am legally required to attend court session and to be told what additional actions I have to take concerning my most recent "crime" such as paying a fine or doing more jail time. Within two weeks I need to pick up my backpack and most of its contents from the police station in Dublin (and I might have to make an appointment to do so (and I can only retrieve my confiscated property on weekdays between mid morning and mid afternoon)). When the police officer wbo was detaining me asked me if there were items from the backpack I wanted to have available to me upon my release from jail, I neglected to mention my car keys but I did remember to ask for my bicycle lock key and legal residence house key which are each tied to a red ribbon, phone, USB-C cable, and wallet. I even asked if I could have my vape pen but the police officer said that the jail would dispose of it unless it stayed in my backpack. Hence, my weed is currently not available. I plan on using my backup backpack, backup sleeping bag, and backup laptop until I get my main backpack back. On Monday I have a midday doctor's appointment to check my hormone levels and a few other vital statistics and the appointment is at a clinic in the middle of San Francisco. I might not have time on Monday to get my backpack back but perhaps Tuesday I will. Well, I'll do my best for now on to avoid getting arrested or injured without giving up my "secret" agenda to keep living outside (but in places where I do not expect to be seriously inconvenienced as a consequence of my being there) and probably aim to go home at least once per week to shower, do laundry, and other house-based activities.
