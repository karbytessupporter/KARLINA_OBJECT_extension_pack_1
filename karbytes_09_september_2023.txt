Today karbytes published a new web page which is assumed by karbytes to be closed off to future changes at the following Uniform Resource Locator (URL):

https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/m_disc_karbytes_2023_data_files_list/

That web page whose URL is the previous line of text is not obviously discover-able just by visiting the home page of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com because its contents are not listed visibly on any web pages which are opened as a result of a website visitor first visiting the home page of that website and then clicking on hyperlink text links to arrive at a specific web hosted document.

Note that web pages can be looked up using the built-in WordPress dot Com search feature of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com at the following "nonexistent web page":

https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/666

The following URL features a screenshot of the web page whose URL is the previous line of text:

The only major limitation which I am currently aware of concerning the search function in my websites (i.e. Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com and Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com) is the fact that not all karbytes blog content is hosted on WordPress servers. 

(If a file which is part of karbytes' blogging is not hosted on WordPress dot Com servers, then that file is hosted on GitHub dot Com servers in a public karbytes-created GitHub repository. Only files which are stored on WordPress dot Com servers (and within the website's domain) are searchable via the search function on that WordPress website).

I think that future content which karbytes publishes to its blog (i.e. GitHub and WordPress (and eventually the WayBack Machine at Archive dot Org)) will be more succinct, orderly, non-redundant, and cost-effecient (in terms of minimizing subjective suffering especially from karbytes' point of view) such that the future content will be easier to navigate and more enjoyable to produce and to consume (according to karbytes' point of view) than was karbytes' past content (i.e. the stuff which has been backed up to M_DISC under the label karbytes_2023).

karbytes tentatively plans on creating another set of M_DISCs approximately one year from now of the content which would be considered to be the sequel to karbytes_2023. karbytes plans on naming next year's M_DISCs karbytes_2024.
