(Note that in the screenshot image of the conversation I was having with chatGPT, I accidentally cut off the remainder of that conversation while making the screenshot. I did not save the conversation. Hence, this is all I have as empirical evidence that the conversation ever existed. I was inspired to initiate that conversation when I saw a stray ant crawl across my laptop and phone screen).
