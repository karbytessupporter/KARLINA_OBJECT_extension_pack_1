(Note that in the screenshot image of the conversation I was having with chatGPT, I accidentally cut off the remainder of that conversation while making the screenshot. I did not save the conversation. Hence, this is all I have as empirical evidence that the conversation ever existed. I was inspired to initiate that conversation when I saw a stray ant crawl across my laptop and phone screen).

(Note that, approximately 30 minutes after uploading the screenshot I took of my comment to an Instagram post about requiring all users to pay a monthly fee to use Twitter, I want to redact what I said as drunken folly. Of course I condone keeping the platform free to use at a basic level. That would like be having to pay for Twitter's servers to stay running).

Another fallacious claim I now redact approximately three hours after I published the screenshot of the Instagram post comment is that robots are not paid for their upkeep and not paid for their labor. They are and I can and have provided screenshot evidence of the fact that my usage of chatGPT is some fixed dollar amount per some fixed data amount. <span style="background:#ffff00">Anything which occupies some finite and empirically measurable allocation of space, time, and energy (i.e. matter) (whether that thing is software or hardware) requires energetic inputs (i.e. work) to remain substantiated.</span>
