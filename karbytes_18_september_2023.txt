S: "Do some humans think with more data throughput (i.e. bytes per second) than do other humans?"

T: "I would assume yes (but I do not yet know of a feasible way to prove that some humans think in terms of more data throughput than others."

R: "Why does it matter? T basically said there is no way (at least here and now) to conclusively (to some arbitrarily high degree of certainty less than one hundred percent) answer S's question. Therefore, we should only be concerned with behaviors and biometric data which is empirically measurable 'in (arbitrarily approximate) real time'."

karbytes: "What R proposed sounds to me like the means to grant humans some degree of privacy of thought (though I do prefer to believe that (a) a planetary surveillance system monitors all human brain activity on Planet Earth simultaneously and continuously using stealth means to gather data and (b) all pieces of matter which currently exist are in constant energy exchanges and that each of such transactions influences every other transaction in the universe (though I am currently undecided whether or not some of those transactions have more degrees of influence than other transactions in the universe))."

R: "I think karbytes is stupid. Otherwise, karbytes would say that some transactions cost more energy to implement than others. Of course the highest throughput consumes the most energy!"
