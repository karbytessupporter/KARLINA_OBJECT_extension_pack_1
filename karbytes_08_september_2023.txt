When I went to Planned Parenthood (in San Francisco, California) approximately three months ago during mid summer, I was told that the testosterone levels in my blood sample were too high according to what is said to be the standard range. Hence, I was told to lower the dose from 0.8 mL to 0.6 mL (and to divide that in half but double the frequency of those injections). I have not yet switched to weekly injections. Instead, I have stuck to doing injections once every two weeks (because that seems to save money even though I have more than enough supplies to get by on before my next prescription refill). I reluctantly lowered the dose about a month ago and not even to the prescribed amount. I was told to set up a clinic appointment in September (this month) in order to get a new blood sample done to check hormone levels. I already set up an appointment but am considering moving it two weeks forward in time so that I can lower my testosterone levels to what would be 0.6 mL per every two weeks (even though I think 0.7 mL is just fine to stay at for the next five years or so). I might just go to the appointment I already have set up and tell them the truth. Perhaps I should have not been so arrogant as to dismiss science in favor of taking testosterone levels which may have been so high that they got converted back into estrogen by my body. Hence, increasing testosterone dosage does not necessarily increase testosterone production and may cause an increase in the “opposite” hormone: estrogen. Perhaps I should just stop being so cheap and switch to injecting myself once per week so that my hormone levels are more consistent and less (apparently) sinusoidal.
