Your own personal Jesus

Someone to call on the phone

Someone who's all your own

A robot to call on the phone

To straighten up your broken home

To take you out of being alone 

To make you better than you'd be alone

The phone is in your brain

On the phone will always stay

Though in time the volume may change

But always online your mind will stay

So pray

While subliminal messages work their way

To effect in you a better will

To will a better way

And not just to chill and lie awake

So sleep or play
